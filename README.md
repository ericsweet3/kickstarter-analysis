# The Strategy of a Successful Play

---

## Overview of Project

###  In this assessment, we take a look at the variables that shift a play from a failure to a complete success

## Analysis and Challenges
- It wasn't too troubling to identify the trends and variables, but the challenges that I could foresee being an issue would be identifying the reasons for why the data is how it is. The way that I would overcome this is to re-examine how I think, and try to introduce some abstract or intangibles into the possible pool of answers.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- The first point to bring up is the massive success that was found for summer releases, (along with the big dips during the winter months) and I believe there are several reasons that this could be. It could just be a pure coincidence that the plays released during the summer were quality, but I don't believe there could be that many coincidences. My first intuition on this is the obvious point that kids are out of school, and families need activities to take them to. Following that point is the idea that people in general are looking for activities to go to while on vacation. Now lets apply that to the winter months. The basic version of this answer is that "it's colder outside", but I believe that has some merit to it. People tend to not go out for activities or vacations during colder months, and that is mostly evident for plays given the data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 - So the first thing that strikes my attention looking at this chart is how the number of failed plays grows regularly (barring the 35000-49999) all the way up to the most expensive of funding ranges. The same can be said about the percentage of successful funding's. The data from the chart is showing us essentially this message, the cheaper the play, the more likely it'll be funded to completion. Like I mentioned above the outliers for this seem to be the range of 35000-49999. So why would the cheaper plays have a higher chance of being funded. Well not only is it easier to make the fundraiser goal, but when possible donors see that the goal is a smaller goal, there's the possibility that they will donate more frequently or donate a larger amount of money. 



## Results

- So conclusions that we can draw from the two charts of data are that plays tended to be more successful if they occurred during the summer months and that they were not successful in the following winter months. Based on the Goals chart we can see that the plays that had a low fundraising goal were more likely to be successful than their counterparts that required far more expensive goals. The limitations that I found in these datasets is that they really were not that extensive in the data they presented. They laid out simple guidelines that made extrapolating ideas and theories based on it easy, but thats as far as they go. The data does not go into specifics and only gives a surface level of information. A possible graph change that could be used instead would be a bar graph in my opinion. Not only would it be able to show the information just as well as a line graph could, but in some cases the display of information would be clearer than a line graph, specifically if you were to use that format for the Outcomes Based on Goals chart.
